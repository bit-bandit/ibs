+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

ibs is a simple, old-school, mostly plain-text(UTF-8 supported),
file-system-based forum software for people who just wanna hang onto the good
old days without having to leave the comfort of their internet browser.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STARTING THE SOFTWARE:

Once you've downloaded the source code (And installed DENO too, if your dumb ass
didn't do that already!) run 'deno task run-ibs' in yer terminal, and you
should be good to go.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO USE THIS:

Every thread is a plain-text file which is rendered as an HTML file in your
browser. Additionally, You can append to the file by POSTing to it (See what
we did there?) using the form included at the bottom of the page. If you want
to, you can use a tripcode to uniquely identify yourself.

Every thread can be observed from the root (/) of the website. You can also
create a thread here, nearly identically to how you would with adding to one,
but with the addition of a thread name parameter.

We really can't say much else about it - It's that simple.
